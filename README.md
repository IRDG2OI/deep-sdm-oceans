# Deep-SDMs in the open oceans

This is the code used to train the model, and prepare the outputs for the preprint named **Predicting species distributions in the open oceans with convolutional neural networks**, available on .

This code uses the Malpolon framework, created and maintained by the Pl@ntNet team at INRIA.
See the [original repository](https://github.com/plantnet/malpolon) for installation instructions and documentation.
